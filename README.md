# Sitewide Comment Control #

When you run a network, managing commenters is handled per-site. That's normally okay, but sometimes people decide to be trolls and spam your whole network. This plugin allows you to ban, spam or moderate an unregistered commenter network wide. It does not replace the per-site blacklists or moderation lists, but acts as addition.

Sitewide Comment Control checks the author name, email address and IP address of a commenter. If they're found to be on the list, all comments will be shunted appropriately as determined by the Network Admin:

* Trash - all flagged comments do directly to trash
* Moderated - all flagged comments require human moderation
* Spam - all flagged comments go to spam

Once installed, you can call it's functions if you wanted to hook into Jetpack or something for contact forms and harassment. Funtimes!
