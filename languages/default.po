msgid "When you run a network, blacklisting commenters is handled per-site. That's normally okay, but sometimes people decide to be trolls and spam your whole network. This plugin allows you to ban, spam or moderate an unregistered commenter network wide. It does not replace the per-site blacklists or moderation lists, but simply adds on to it."

If you pick 'blackhole', no one will ever see the comment. Pick 'spam' and they go to spam. Pick 'moderate' and the post is forced into moderation."
